// # Introduction Collection
//   - Collections are common things that are common in programming languages,
//     such as PHP, Python, Ruby and others.
//   - Collections or sometimes called containers,
//     are objects that collect or contain data, similar to Arrays.
//   - Java has provided collection classes that we can use directly,
//     without additional libraries.
//   - All collection classes in Java are generic classes,
//     so we can use Java collections with any data.
//
// # Java Collection
//   - Java collections have provided everything related to collections,
//     so we just need to use it:
//     + Interfaces, this is a contract representation of the collection.
//       All collections in Java have an interface contract, so if we want,
//       we can also create our own implementation.
//     + Implementations, no need to worry, we can also use implementations
//       that have been created by Java, all collection interfaces already
//       have class implementations in the Java collection.
//     + Algorithms, Java also provides algorithms that are commonly
//       used in collections, such as searching and sorting data in collections.
